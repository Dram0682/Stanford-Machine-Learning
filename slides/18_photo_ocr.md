## Application Example - Photo OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) enables computers to interpret text within images. This process involves a machine learning pipeline comprising several steps, each focused on a specific aspect of OCR, like pedestrian or text detection. The pipeline integrates various techniques, including data synthesis, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of character recognition.

### Detailed Mathematical and Technical Aspects

#### I. **Machine Learning Pipeline in OCR:**

- **Systematic Approach:** A machine learning pipeline is a systematic approach involving sequential steps for solving complex problems. It ensures that each phase of the process contributes to the overall goal of accurate text recognition.
- **Pipeline Components:** In OCR, this pipeline includes the generation of training datasets, classifier training, and the application of these classifiers to new data.

#### II. **Training Data and Classifier Development:**

- **Dataset Creation:** Develop a training dataset comprising positive (text) and negative (non-text) image examples. This dataset forms the foundation for training robust classifiers.
- **Classifier Training:** Train a classifier using this dataset. The classifier learns to differentiate between text and non-text image patches, forming the basis for accurate text detection.

#### III. **Sliding Window Technique:**

- **Implementation:** Implement a sliding window technique to apply the classifier across different sections of an image. This involves moving a window across the image, classifying each patch as text or non-text.
- **Efficiency:** This method ensures that all parts of the image are examined systematically, increasing the chances of detecting text accurately.

#### IV. **Character Recognition:**

- **Focus on Characters:** After detecting text regions, the focus shifts to recognizing individual characters within these regions.
- **Specialized Training Set:** Use a specialized training set of character images, which enhances the classifierâ€™s ability to recognize different characters accurately.
- **Data Synthesis:** Employ data synthesis, such as introducing distortions to character images, to enhance training data variability. This process makes the model more robust to variations in real-world data.

### Problem Description and Pipeline

#### Understanding the Photo OCR Problem

- **Challenge:** The primary challenge is teaching computers to interpret text in digital images efficiently and accurately.
- **Complexity:** This involves dealing with variations in text appearance, such as different fonts, sizes, orientations, and background noise.

#### The Pipeline Structure

- **Modular Approach:** Photo OCR involves a sequence of distinct modules, each handling a part of the process. These modules may include machine learning algorithms and data processing steps, each contributing to the overall goal of accurate text recognition.

Here's a mock Python code demonstrating a pipeline for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks, including image preprocessing, text detection, segmentation, and character recognition.

```python
# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import pytesseract
from skimage.segmentation import clear_border
from skimage.measure import label, regionprops
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Load and preprocess the image
def load_preprocess_image(filepath):
    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(filepath, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Preprocess the image (e.g., thresholding)
    _, processed_image = cv2.threshold(image, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    return processed_image

# Step 3: Text detection
def detect_text(image):
    # Use pytesseract to detect text
    text_boxes = pytesseract.image_to_boxes(image)
    return text_boxes

# Step 4: Text segmentation
def segment_text(image):
    # Clear the borders and label the image
    cleared = clear_border(image)
    label_image = label(cleared)
    
    # Extract regions (potential characters)
    regions = regionprops(label_image)
    return regions

# Step 5: Character recognition
def recognize_characters(image, regions):
    characters = []
    for region in regions:
        # Extract each character
        minr, minc, maxr, maxc = region.bbox
        char_image = image[minr:maxr, minc:maxc]
        
        # Recognize the character using pytesseract
        char_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(char_image, config='--psm 10')
        characters.append(char_text)
    return characters

# Step 6: Visualize results
def visualize_results(image, text_boxes, characters):
    # Plot the original image with detected text boxes
    plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
    for box, char in zip(text_boxes.splitlines(), characters):
        b = box.split(' ')
        x, y, w, h = int(b[1]), int(b[2]), int(b[3]), int(b[4])
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, h), (w, y), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        plt.text(x, y, char, color='red', fontsize=12)
    plt.show()

# Main function to execute the OCR pipeline
def main(filepath):
    image = load_preprocess_image(filepath)
    text_boxes = detect_text(image)
    regions = segment_text(image)
    characters = recognize_characters(image, regions)
    visualize_results(image, text_boxes, characters)

# Execute the OCR pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = 'path_to_your_image_file.png'
    main(filepath)
```

You can customize each step based on your specific OCR requirements and data.

### Pedestrian Detection (Analogous Example)

#### Training Data Collection

- **Positive and Negative Examples:** Collect a set of images containing pedestrians (positive examples) and images without them (negative examples). This data forms the basis for training the pedestrian detection model.
  
![Pedestrian Training Set](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/pedestrians_training_set.png)

#### Classifier Application

- **Standard Human Aspect Ratio:** Apply the trained classifier on a new image using a standard human aspect ratio patch (e.g., 82 x 36 pixels). This step involves moving the patch across the image to detect pedestrians.
- **Iterative Process:** Iterate this process across the entire image, adjusting the patch position and size to ensure comprehensive pedestrian detection.
  
![Pedestrians](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/pedestrians.png)

Here is a mock Python code demonstrating the application of a trained classifier to detect pedestrians using a standard human aspect ratio patch (82 x 36 pixels). The code will iterate over the entire image, adjusting the patch position and size to ensure comprehensive detection.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the trained classifier
def load_classifier(model_path):
    classifier = joblib.load(model_path)
    return classifier

# Function to slide window across the image
def sliding_window(image, step_size, window_size):
    for y in range(0, image.shape[0] - window_size[1], step_size):
        for x in range(0, image.shape[1] - window_size[0], step_size):
            yield (x, y, image[y:y + window_size[1], x:x + window_size[0]])

# Function to resize the image
def resize_image(image, scale_percent):
    width = int(image.shape[1] * scale_percent / 100)
    height = int(image.shape[0] * scale_percent / 100)
    dim = (width, height)
    resized = cv2.resize(image, dim, interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA)
    return resized

# Apply classifier on each patch
def apply_classifier(image, classifier):
    window_size = (82, 36)  # Standard human aspect ratio patch
    step_size = 10  # Step size for moving the patch
    detections = []

    # Iterate over multiple scales
    for scale in range(10, 110, 10):
        resized_image = resize_image(image, scale)
        for (x, y, window) in sliding_window(resized_image, step_size, window_size):
            if window.shape[0] != window_size[1] or window.shape[1] != window_size[0]:
                continue

            # Feature extraction (example using HOG)
            hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()
            features = hog.compute(window).reshape(1, -1)

            # Predict using the classifier
            prediction = classifier.predict(features)

            if prediction == 1:  # Assuming 1 indicates pedestrian
                detections.append((x, y, x + window_size[0], y + window_size[1], scale))

    return detections

# Draw detections on the image
def draw_detections(image, detections):
    for (x1, y1, x2, y2, scale) in detections:
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow('Detections', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Main function to execute the detection pipeline
def main(image_path, model_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    classifier = load_classifier(model_path)
    detections = apply_classifier(image, classifier)
    draw_detections(image, detections)

# Execute the detection pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = 'path_to_your_image_file.jpg'
    model_path = 'path_to_your_trained_model.pkl'
    main(image_path, model_path)
```

The classifier should be trained beforehand and saved as a `.pkl` file. The sliding window and resizing steps ensure that pedestrians of different sizes are detected across the entire image.

### Text Detection in Images

#### Training and Classifier Deployment

- **Training Set:** Similar to pedestrian detection, prepare a training set with examples of text and non-text. This dataset is crucial for training the text detection model.
- **Predefined Window:** Apply a trained classifier to an image using a predefined rectangular window, systematically scanning the image for potential text regions.
  
![Text Detection](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/text_detection.png)

Here is a mock Python code demonstrating the process of training a text detection classifier.

```python
# Mock Python Code for Training a Text Detection Classifier

import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Function to extract features from images
def extract_features(image):
    # Example: Using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
    hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()
    features = hog.compute(image)
    return features.flatten()

# Load and prepare the training dataset
def prepare_training_set(pos_image_paths, neg_image_paths):
    X = []
    y = []

    # Load positive samples (text images)
    for path in pos_image_paths:
        image = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
        features = extract_features(image)
        X.append(features)
        y.append(1)  # Label for text

    # Load negative samples (non-text images)
    for path in neg_image_paths:
        image = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
        features = extract_features(image)
        X.append(features)
        y.append(0)  # Label for non-text

    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Train the classifier
def train_classifier(X, y):
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    classifier.fit(X, y)
    return classifier

# Main function for training
def main_train(pos_image_paths, neg_image_paths, model_path):
    X, y = prepare_training_set(pos_image_paths, neg_image_paths)
    classifier = train_classifier(X, y)
    joblib.dump(classifier, model_path)

# Execute the training
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pos_image_paths = ['path_to_positive_image1.jpg', 'path_to_positive_image2.jpg']  # Add all paths
    neg_image_paths = ['path_to_negative_image1.jpg', 'path_to_negative_image2.jpg']  # Add all paths
    model_path = 'path_to_save_trained_model.pkl'
    main_train(pos_image_paths, neg_image_paths, model_path)
```

#### Region Identification

- **Confidence Levels:** The classifier outputs varying confidence levels, represented by shades of gray, indicating the likelihood of text presence. Higher confidence levels indicate a higher likelihood of text presence.
- **Expansion Algorithm:** Use an expansion algorithm to identify and enlarge potential text regions. This involves merging nearby regions and eliminating improbable ones based on size or aspect ratio.
    
![Expansion Algorithm](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/expansion_algorithm.png)

Here is a mock Python code demonstrating region identification for text detection. This includes handling classifier confidence levels and applying an expansion algorithm to identify and enlarge potential text regions.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from skimage.measure import label, regionprops

# Load the trained classifier
def load_classifier(model_path):
    classifier = joblib.load(model_path)
    return classifier

# Function to slide window across the image and obtain confidence levels
def sliding_window_confidence(image, step_size, window_size, classifier):
    confidence_map = np.zeros((image.shape[0], image.shape[1]), dtype=np.float32)

    for y in range(0, image.shape[0] - window_size[1], step_size):
        for x in range(0, image.shape[1] - window_size[0], step_size):
            window = image[y:y + window_size[1], x:x + window_size[0]]
            if window.shape[0] != window_size[1] or window.shape[1] != window_size[0]:
                continue

            # Feature extraction (example using HOG)
            hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()
            features = hog.compute(window).reshape(1, -1)

            # Predict confidence using the classifier
            confidence = classifier.predict_proba(features)[0][1]  # Confidence for text class

            # Assign confidence to the confidence map
            confidence_map[y:y + window_size[1], x:x + window_size[0]] = confidence

    return confidence_map

# Function to apply expansion algorithm
def expand_regions(confidence_map, threshold):
    # Threshold the confidence map to create a binary mask
    binary_map = (confidence_map > threshold).astype(np.uint8)

    # Label connected components
    labeled_map = label(binary_map)

    # Initialize a list to store bounding boxes of text regions
    text_regions = []

    # Iterate over detected regions
    for region in regionprops(labeled_map):
        # Get the bounding box of the region
        min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col = region.bbox

        # Filter out improbable regions based on size or aspect ratio
        region_height = max_row - min_row
        region_width = max_col - min_col
        aspect_ratio = region_width / region_height

        if region_height > 5 and region_width > 5 and 0.2 < aspect_ratio < 5:
            text_regions.append((min_col, min_row, max_col, max_row))

    return text_regions

# Draw text regions on the image
def draw_text_regions(image, text_regions):
    for (x1, y1, x2, y2) in text_regions:
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow('Text Regions', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Main function to execute the region identification
def main_region_identification(image_path, model_path, confidence_threshold):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    classifier = load_classifier(model_path)
    window_size = (82, 36)  # Predefined window size for text detection
    step_size = 10  # Step size for moving the window

    # Obtain confidence map
    confidence_map = sliding_window_confidence(image, step_size, window_size, classifier)

    # Apply expansion algorithm to identify text regions
    text_regions = expand_regions(confidence_map, confidence_threshold)

    # Draw identified text regions on the image
    draw_text_regions(image, text_regions)

# Execute the region identification pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = 'path_to_your_image_file.jpg'
    model_path = 'path_to_your_trained_model.pkl'
    confidence_threshold = 0.5  # Set a threshold for text confidence
    main_region_identification(image_path, model_path, confidence_threshold)
```

The classifier should be trained beforehand and saved as a `.pkl` file. The confidence map visualizes the classifier's confidence in detecting text, and the expansion algorithm merges and filters regions to identify potential text areas.

### Character Segmentation

#### 1D Sliding Window Approach

- **Sliding Window:** Slide a one-dimensional window along identified text areas. This technique helps in segmenting the text into individual characters.
- **Character Separation:** Determine if each window segment represents a potential character separation. Insert divisions between characters when appropriate to ensure accurate segmentation.
  
![Character Segmentation](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/character_segmentation.png)

Here's a mock Python code for a 1D sliding window approach to segment text into individual characters. This involves sliding a one-dimensional window along identified text areas and determining character separation.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Function to preprocess the text area
def preprocess_text_area(text_area):
    # Convert to binary image (thresholding)
    _, binary_image = cv2.threshold(text_area, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    return binary_image

# Function to perform 1D sliding window for character segmentation
def sliding_window_1d(text_area, window_width):
    height, width = text_area.shape
    character_separations = []

    # Sum pixel values vertically to get a 1D projection profile
    vertical_projection = np.sum(text_area, axis=0)

    for x in range(0, width - window_width + 1):
        window_sum = np.sum(vertical_projection[x:x + window_width])
        if window_sum == 0:
            character_separations.append(x + window_width // 2)

    return character_separations

# Function to draw character separations on the image
def draw_character_separations(text_area, character_separations):
    output_image = cv2.cvtColor(text_area, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    for x in character_separations:
        cv2.line(output_image, (x, 0), (x, output_image.shape[0]), (0, 0, 255), 2)
    return output_image

# Main function for character segmentation
def main_character_segmentation(image_path, text_bounding_box):
    # Load the image and extract the text area
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = text_bounding_box
    text_area = image[y1:y2, x1:x2]

    # Preprocess the text area
    preprocessed_text_area = preprocess_text_area(text_area)

    # Perform 1D sliding window for character segmentation
    window_width = 3  # Width of the sliding window
    character_separations = sliding_window_1d(preprocessed_text_area, window_width)

    # Draw character separations on the text area
    segmented_image = draw_character_separations(preprocessed_text_area, character_separations)

    # Display the result
    plt.imshow(segmented_image)
    plt.title('Character Segmentation')
    plt.show()

# Execute the character segmentation pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = 'path_to_your_image_file.jpg'
    text_bounding_box = (50, 100, 300, 150)  # Example bounding box coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    main_character_segmentation(image_path, text_bounding_box)
```

The code assumes a predefined bounding box (`text_bounding_box`) for the text area within the image. The `sliding_window_1d` function identifies potential character boundaries based on the vertical projection profile of the text area, and the separations are visualized by drawing red lines on the image.

### Character Recognition through Data Synthesis

#### Training Data Enhancement

- **Grayscale Images:** To recognize characters from image patches, consider using grayscale images for simplicity. This reduces the complexity of the recognition process.
- **Vast Training Set:** Generate a vast training set by using characters from various fonts and placing them on random backgrounds. This enhances the modelâ€™s ability to recognize characters in different contexts.
- **Distortion Introduction:** Introduce distortions to existing data for a more robust training process. This makes the model more resilient to variations in character appearance.
  
![Characters](https://github.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/blob/main/slides/resources/characters.png)

Below is a mock Python code for training data enhancement for character recognition. This includes using grayscale images, generating a vast training set with various fonts and random backgrounds, and introducing distortions to make the model more robust.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import random
import os

# Function to generate random backgrounds
def generate_random_background(width, height):
    background = np.random.randint(0, 256, (height, width), dtype=np.uint8)
    return background

# Function to overlay text on random background
def overlay_text_on_background(text, font_path, font_size, background):
    height, width = background.shape
    image = Image.fromarray(background)
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    font = ImageFont.truetype(font_path, font_size)
    text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(text, font=font)
    position = ((width - text_width) // 2, (height - text_height) // 2)
    draw.text(position, text, font=font, fill=(255,))
    return np.array(image)

# Function to introduce distortions
def introduce_distortions(image):
    # Example distortions: rotation, scaling, and noise
    rows, cols = image.shape

    # Rotation
    angle = random.uniform(-10, 10)
    M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((cols / 2, rows / 2), angle, 1)
    rotated = cv2.warpAffine(image, M, (cols, rows))

    # Scaling
    scale = random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
    scaled = cv2.resize(rotated, None, fx=scale, fy=scale, interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)

    # Adding noise
    noise = np.random.randint(0, 50, (rows, cols), dtype=np.uint8)
    noisy_image = cv2.add(scaled, noise)

    return noisy_image

# Function to create training data
def create_training_data(characters, font_paths, num_samples_per_char, image_size):
    X = []
    y = []

    for char in characters:
        for font_path in font_paths:
            for _ in range(num_samples_per_char):
                # Generate random background
                background = generate_random_background(image_size, image_size)
                
                # Overlay text on background
                font_size = random.randint(20, 40)
                char_image = overlay_text_on_background(char, font_path, font_size, background)
                
                # Convert to grayscale
                gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(char_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
                
                # Introduce distortions
                distorted_image = introduce_distortions(gray_image)
                
                # Append to dataset
                X.append(distorted_image)
                y.append(char)

    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Save the generated images for visualization
def save_generated_images(X, y, output_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)
    for i, (image, label) in enumerate(zip(X, y)):
        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f'{label}_{i}.png')
        cv2.imwrite(output_path, image)

# Main function to create and save the training dataset
def main_training_data_enhancement(characters, font_paths, num_samples_per_char, image_size, output_dir):
    X, y = create_training_data(characters, font_paths, num_samples_per_char, image_size)
    save_generated_images(X, y, output_dir)

# Execute the training data enhancement
if __name__ == "__main__":
    characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
    font_paths = ['path_to_font1.ttf', 'path_to_font2.ttf']  # Add paths to different font files
    num_samples_per_char = 100  # Number of samples per character
    image_size = 64  # Size of the generated image (64x64 pixels)
    output_dir = 'path_to_output_directory'
    main_training_data_enhancement(characters, font_paths, num_samples_per_char, image_size, output_dir)
```

By using different fonts and random backgrounds, the model can learn to recognize characters in various contexts, making it more robust and effective in real-world scenarios.
